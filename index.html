          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>I am a software engineer at Publicis Sapient. I studied Law at the University of Nottingham
            before choosing to do a conversion Masters in Computer Science at Birkbeck, University of London.
            I love coding and learning new things, and I am currently training to become a full-stack engineer.

            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>I am quite new to web development, particularly on the front end side. I am more confident working on
                backend projects however I am currently learning JavaScript and React to better understand how to 
                build high quality, modern web applications. The language I am perhaps most confident in is Java, though
                I recently used Python to build a machine learning model that I embedded into a React application.

            <h3>Mario Kart</h3>
            <p>I am quite awesome at Mario Kart because I simply am and can't help being good at everything.</p>

            <h3>Painting & Drawing</h3>
            <p>I have always loved creating art and am particularly fascinated by architecture and buildings. I love
                the details and how you can turn intricate work into an abstract concept. My main mediums are pen, 
                watercolour, and markers however I am still learning various techniques to try and find my ideal style.

            <h3>Cooking</h3>
            <p>I started cooking more regularly after I graduated from university and rediscovered my love of food. 
                I experimented with different cuisines and flavours, rooting recipes in my own heritage to 
                better understand its influence. My strengths lie in Pakistani food however I also love Korean food and
                often recreate recipes that I see on social media sites.
